My name is Zhengtong Zhu (朱政同). I am a graduate student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, supervised by Prof. Jiaqing Fan. My research interests include video object segmentation, self-supervised learning, and multimodal understanding. I am currently seeking a platform that can support me in advancing my research further.

As of November 2025, as a second-year graduate student and an early-stage researcher, I have made several achievements. I have one first-author paper accepted by the top-tier conference AAAI, and I currently have two papers under review at CVPR and IEEE TMM.
